Day 6: Django Project Setup and LDAP Integration (12 June)

I. Starting the Django LMS Project

Today I set up the base Django project for our Genco LMS. I created the main project structure, set up the initial settings (like database config, installed apps, and middleware), and made sure the local dev environment was ready with the right Python version and a virtual environment. This gives us a solid base for building out the rest of the app.

II. Adding LDAP Authentication

I installed the django-auth-ldap package using pip and added it to INSTALLED_APPS. Then I set it as the main AUTHENTICATION_BACKEND in settings.py, so Django will use LDAP for user logins instead of the default database backend. This will let us connect our app’s login system to the central LDAP directory.

III. Connecting Django to OpenLDAP

I configured the AUTH_LDAP_SERVER_URI in settings.py to point to our OpenLDAP server (using ldap:// and the right host/port). I also set up the anonymous bind parameters so Django can look up users in LDAP before authenticating them. With this, the app is ready to talk to the LDAP server for user authentication.
     - Anonymous bind configuration flags
     - Connection timeout parameters
     - TLS/SSL encryption specification (where applicable)
     - LDAP protocol version specification

These foundational connection parameters establish the initial communication framework between the Django application and the OpenLDAP directory infrastructure, enabling the application to query user accounts, verify credentials, and retrieve user attributes from the centralized directory service. The configuration of these parameters represents a critical intermediate step in implementing comprehensive LDAP authentication integration.
