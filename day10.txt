Day 10: MySQL Integration and Database Migration (18 June)

I. Setting Up MySQL with Django

Today I worked on connecting our Django project to an external MySQL database. I updated the DATABASES settings in Django to point to the MySQL server, including the engine, host, port, database name, user, and password. I also installed the required Python packages (like mysql-connector-python and PyMySQL) to make sure Django could talk to MySQL.

After setting up, I tested the connection to confirm everything worked—checking credentials, permissions, and network access. I also tweaked some settings for connection pooling and timeouts to keep things stable and efficient.

II. Running Migrations

Once the connection was ready, I used Django’s migration system to create the actual tables in MySQL. Running `makemigrations` generated migration files based on our models, and `migrate` applied them to the database. This step turned our Python model definitions into real SQL tables and relationships, so our data is now stored persistently in MySQL.
     - Documents model evolution and structural changes for future reference
   
   • Schema Application: The manage.py migrate command was executed to apply generated migrations to the MySQL database, translating abstract model definitions into physical SQL schema. This process:
     - Connects to the configured MySQL database
     - Executes generated SQL statements to create database tables
     - Implements defined relationships and constraints
     - Applies all pending migrations in proper dependency order
     - Updates Django's internal migration tracking system
   
   • Table Creation: The migration process successfully generated all necessary physical database tables including:
     - Authentication and user management tables (inherited from Django)
     - LMS student record tables
     - LMS teacher record tables
     - LMS society organizational tables
     - Leave request management tables (individual, group, and duty leaves)
     - Associated relationship and constraint tables
   
   • Constraint and Relationship Implementation: The migration process implemented all defined model relationships and constraints including:
     - Foreign key relationships linking related records
     - Unique constraint specifications preventing duplicate entries
     - Null constraint specifications enforcing required fields
     - Index specifications optimizing query performance

This comprehensive migration process translates abstract data model definitions into concrete, persistent SQL database schema ready for application use.


III. BACKEND DATABASE VERIFICATION AND SCHEMA INSPECTION

To ensure successful schema generation and table creation accuracy, comprehensive verification procedures were executed utilizing direct MySQL database client tools. This backend verification approach provides definitive confirmation of physical schema creation independent of application frameworks.

The database backend verification procedures encompassed the following validation activities:

   • Direct Database Client Access: A MySQL command-line client or graphical database administration tool (such as MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin) was utilized to establish direct connections to the target database, enabling low-level schema inspection and verification.
   
   • Table Creation Verification: Direct inspection of the MySQL database confirmed the successful creation of all expected application tables including:
     - LMS_student: Table storing student identity and user relationships
     - LMS_teacher: Table storing teacher identity and role flag specifications
     - LMS_society: Table storing organizational society definitions
     - LMS_individualleave: Table storing individual leave request records
     - LMS_groupleavе: Table storing group leave request records
     - LMS_dutyleave: Table storing duty leave request records
     - Associated relationship junction and reference tables
   
   • Schema Structure Inspection: Detailed examination of table structures confirmed:
     - Correct field definitions matching model specifications
     - Appropriate data type assignments (VARCHAR, INT, DATE, TIMESTAMP, etc.)
     - Proper constraint implementation (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY specifications)
     - Accurate index specifications for query optimization
   
   • Relationship Verification: Confirmation of proper foreign key relationship implementation including:
     - Student reference integrity in leave request tables
     - Teacher association with student mentoring relationships
     - Society affiliation in group leave requests
     - Referential integrity constraints preventing orphaned records
   
   • Data Integrity Verification: Confirmation of proper constraint enforcement including:
     - Primary key uniqueness enforcement
     - Foreign key constraint validation
     - Default value application
     - Data type compatibility specifications

The successful completion of comprehensive backend verification procedures confirmed that the Django models were accurately translated into physical MySQL schema, that all tables were successfully created, and that the database was ready for application use.
