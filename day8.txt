Day 8: RBAC and Group Sync in Django (16 June)

I. Syncing LDAP Groups with Django

Today I set up AUTH_LDAP_MIRROR_GROUPS so that whenever a user logs in, their LDAP groups (like teachers, students, societyadmins) are automatically created and updated as Django Groups. This keeps group memberships in sync between LDAP and Django, so permissions and roles stay consistent.

II. Mapping Groups to Roles

I configured role mapping so that being in a certain LDAP group gives you a specific Django role. For example, teachers get the 'Mentor' role, societyadmins get 'HOD', and students get 'Learner'. This is handled using AUTH_LDAP_GROUP_SEARCH and AUTH_LDAP_GROUP_TYPE, which let Django check group membership and assign roles on login.

III. Testing Authorization and Access

After setting this up, I tested logging in with different users and checked that they got the right roles and access to their dashboards. The system now blocks users from accessing dashboards above their privilege level, and redirects them if they try. Everything works as expected, and the RBAC setup feels solid.


III. AUTHORIZATION VERIFICATION AND ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL ENFORCEMENT TESTING

To ensure the operational integrity and security effectiveness of the role-based access control implementation, comprehensive verification and testing procedures were executed to validate authorization enforcement, role assignment accuracy, and access control policy compliance.

The authorization verification procedures encompassed the following validation activities:

   • Automatic Role Assignment Verification: Following user authentication events, the automatic role assignment mechanism was verified to confirm that:
     - Users were correctly assigned to Django Group objects corresponding to their LDAP group memberships
     - Role assignments reflected current LDAP group membership status
     - Group memberships were accurately synchronized between the LDAP directory and Django authorization system
     - Users authenticated with test credentials (teacher, student) were assigned appropriate roles (Mentor, Learner)
   
   • Role-Specific Dashboard Access Control: The application's role-based dashboard routing logic was tested to verify that:
     - Each user role was directed to the appropriate role-specific dashboard interface upon successful authentication
     - Dashboard interfaces were correctly tailored to role-specific responsibilities and information requirements
     - Role-specific data access restrictions were properly enforced
   
   • Privilege Escalation Prevention Testing: Critical security testing was conducted to ensure that:
     - Unauthorized users with lower privilege levels (e.g., 'Learner' role) could not access higher-privilege dashboards designated for elevated roles (e.g., 'Mentor' or 'HOD')
     - Redirection mechanisms prevented unauthorized navigation to administrative or privileged interface sections
     - Attempted privilege escalation attacks were properly intercepted and prevented
     - Access control violations resulted in appropriate denial of access and error reporting
   
   • Role-Based Feature Access: Verification was performed to confirm that:
     - Role-specific features and functionality were accessible only to users with appropriate role assignments
     - Cross-role feature access attempts were properly denied
     - Feature availability accurately reflected user authorization levels

The successful completion of comprehensive authorization testing procedures confirmed that the role-based access control implementation was functioning correctly, that role assignments were accurately derived from LDAP group membership, that authorization policies were properly enforced, and that the system maintained adequate security controls preventing unauthorized privilege escalation.
