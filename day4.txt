Day 4: Creating Sample Users and Verifying Setup (10 June)

I. Adding Test Users

Today I created three sample users: admin (for system management), teacher (for faculty tasks), and student (for regular users). I made sure to use strong passwords for each account, following good security practices like using a mix of characters and hashing the passwords.

II. Setting Unix Attributes

For each user, I manually set the Unix attributes: a unique uidNumber and a shared gidNumber for group membership. This is important for making sure the users can be recognized by Unix/Linux systems later, and helps with things like file permissions and group access.

III. Checking Everything with ldapsearch

To double-check my work, I used the ldapsearch command-line tool to look up the new users. I checked that each user was in the right OU (ou=Users), had the correct objectClasses (inetOrgPerson and posixAccount), and all the required fields (like cn, sn, uidNumber, etc.) were filled in. Everything looked good, so the setup is ready for more users and integration.
     - Organizational attributes (mail, telephoneNumber)
   
   • Uniqueness Validation: Verification that all unique identifiers (uidNumber, cn) were distinct across all user entries and that no duplicate values existed.

The successful completion of these verification procedures confirmed that the user provisioning infrastructure was functioning correctly and that all sample user entries possessed the required structure and attributes for subsequent system integration and authentication testing.
