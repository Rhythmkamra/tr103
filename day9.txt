Day 9: Designing the LMS Database Models (17 June)

I. Core Models for Users and Groups

Today I started designing the main database models for our LMS. I created models for Student (linked one-to-one with Django’s User), Teacher (also linked to User, with extra fields for Mentor/HOD roles), and Society (for clubs and group leave features). This structure will help us manage users, roles, and group activities more easily.

II. Individual Leave Model

I designed the IndividualLeave model to track student leave requests. Each leave links to a student, has a reason field, start and end dates, and a status field to show where it is in the approval process (like PENDING_MENTOR, APPROVED, etc.). This should make it easy to follow each request through its workflow and keep a record for audits.

III. Group and Duty Leave Models

I also set up models for GroupLeave and DutyLeave. GroupLeave is for society or event-based requests with multiple participants, and DutyLeave is for official duties like exams or sports. Each model supports different approval paths (e.g., Society Admin for group, Teacher→HOD for duty). This way, the system can handle both individual and group leave scenarios.
   
   • Date Specification Fields: Dedicated date fields capturing temporal parameters of the leave request:
     - Leave Commencement Date: Specifying the date on which the requested leave begins
     - Leave Termination Date: Specifying the final date of the requested leave period
     - Automatic duration calculation enabling leave period quantification
   
   • Custom Status Field: A sophisticated status management field implementing a workflow state machine for tracking leave request progression through the approval process. The status field supports the following workflow states:
     - PENDING_MENTOR: Initial state indicating the request awaits review and approval from the student's assigned mentor
     - MENTOR_APPROVED: State indicating the mentor has reviewed and approved the leave request
     - PENDING_HOD: State indicating the request has progressed to the department head for secondary review
     - HOD_APPROVED: State indicating the department head has approved the leave request
     - REJECTED: Terminal state indicating the request has been denied by an approval authority
     - CANCELLED: Terminal state indicating the student has cancelled the leave request

This comprehensive individual leave model design establishes the data structures necessary for managing individual leave requests and tracking their progression through multi-level approval workflows.


III. GROUP LEAVE AND DUTY LEAVE MULTI-PARTICIPANT DATA MODELS

The design of group-based leave request data models proceeded with comprehensive specification of data structures capable of managing leave requests involving multiple participants and supporting distinct organizational approval pathways.

The group-based leave model architecture encompasses the following entity definitions:

   • GroupLeave Model: A primary entity model designed for managing organizational group leave requests typically involving society-based or event-based collective activities. The GroupLeave model is structured with the following architectural specifications:
     - Multi-Participant Support: Capability to associate multiple student participants with individual group leave requests
     - Society Association: Direct linkage to specific Society entities enabling group leave organization and society administrator assignment
     - Approval Path Specification: Support for society-administrator-centric approval workflows enabling direct approval by designated society administrators
     - Auto-Approval Integration: Implementation of conditional auto-approval mechanisms for eligible requests
   
   • DutyLeave Model: A specialized entity model designed for managing institutional duty or mandatory activity leave requests. The DutyLeave model is structured with the following architectural specifications:
     - Multi-Participant Accommodation: Capability to associate multiple student participants with individual duty leave requests
     - Organizational Hierarchy Integration: Support for hierarchical approval workflows incorporating multiple administrative levels
     - Teacher/HOD Approval Pathways: Distinct approval routing mechanisms directing requests to appropriate Teacher or Department Head review authorities
     - Duty Documentation: Support for documentation of the institutional duty or mandatory activity motivating the leave request
   
   • Distinct Approval Path Architecture: The group-based leave models implement specialized approval workflow paths reflecting organizational structure and approval authority distribution:
     - Society Admin Direct Approval Path: Society-based leave requests (GroupLeave) follow a direct approval path from society administrators, enabling streamlined approval for society-organized activities
     - Teacher-to-HOD Hierarchical Approval Path: Duty-based leave requests (DutyLeave) follow a hierarchical approval workflow progressing from Teacher/Mentor approval to Head of Department secondary review, establishing multi-level oversight for institutional duty assignments

This comprehensive group-based leave model architecture establishes the data structures necessary for managing collective leave requests with support for multiple participants, organizational societies, and distinct hierarchical approval workflows.
