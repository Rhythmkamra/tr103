Day 2: Setting Up OpenLDAP and Basic Configuration (6 June)

I. Installing and Setting Up OpenLDAP

Today I installed OpenLDAP (using the slapd package) on a Debian 11 server. After installation, I checked that the service was running properly. I also set up the admin account with a strong, hashed password to keep things secure.

II. Initial Configuration and Schemas

Next, I configured the base DN for our directory as dc=college,dc=edu using the OLC (Online Configuration) system, which lets you change settings without restarting the service. I loaded the main schemas needed for our use case: cosine (for compatibility), nis (for Unix/Linux attributes), and inetorgperson (for user details). These schemas are important for making sure the directory can handle both people and system accounts.

III. Web Interface with phpLDAPadmin

To make managing LDAP easier, I installed phpLDAPadmin and connected it to the new LDAP server. I was able to log in as the admin and see the base entry (dc=college,dc=edu) in the web interface, which means the setup worked. This tool will help with future management tasks.
