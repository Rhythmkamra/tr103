Day 21: UI Polish & Visual Consistency (3 July)

I. UI Aesthetic Refinement

Today I focused on polishing the user interface for a more professional and consistent look. I standardized spacing, padding, and alignment across all pages, fixed inconsistent element spacing, and made sure everything lines up with the grid. Fonts, sizes, and colors are now consistent, and I checked that text is readable and accessible. Buttons and form fields have a uniform style, with clear focus and hover states. I also improved the visual hierarchy with better headings, icons, and grouping, and made sure the UI looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
     - Breakpoint Testing: Tested all responsive design breakpoints for smooth transitions

This comprehensive UI refinement significantly improves overall application aesthetics and professional appearance.
