Day 1: LDAP Basics and Tool Comparison (5 June)

I. Understanding LDAP Structure

Today I started with the basics of LDAP. I learned that LDAP is a protocol mainly used for reading and searching directory data, and it organizes everything in a tree-like structure called the Directory Information Tree (DIT). Each entry in this tree has a unique Distinguished Name (DN), which acts like its full address. Organizational Units (OUs) are used to group users and resources logically, making it easier to manage large numbers of entries.

II. Why LDAP for College Systems?

I looked into why LDAP is useful in a college setting. The main reason is to have a single place for managing all user accounts, so students and staff can use one login for different services like Wi-Fi, email, and portals. This makes things simpler for both users and admins, especially when someone joins or leaves the college.

III. Tools for Managing LDAP

I tried out two tools: phpLDAPadmin and LAM (LDAP Account Manager). phpLDAPadmin gives you a lot of control and lets you see and edit everything in the directory, but it can be a bit overwhelming if you’re new. LAM, on the other hand, is more user-friendly and uses forms for common tasks, which is great for everyday management. Both tools have their strengths depending on what you need to do.
