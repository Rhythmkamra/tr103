I. ORGANIZATIONAL GROUP STRUCTURE ESTABLISHMENT

The implementation of group-based access control and organizational segmentation proceeded with the creation of primary functional groups designed to represent the principal organizational roles and administrative categories within the institutional environment. These groups were systematically established within the designated organizational unit (ou=Groups,dc=college,dc=edu) to maintain clear administrative boundaries and facilitate scalable group management operations.

Three primary functional groups were created and configured as follows:

   • teachers: An organizational group designated to encompass all faculty and instructional staff members, facilitating unified policy application and collective resource access management for educational personnel.
   
   • students: An organizational group designated to encompass all enrolled students and learner population members, enabling streamlined administration of student-specific policies, permissions, and educational resources.
   
   • societyadmins: An organizational group designated to encompass administrative personnel responsible for group management, resource governance, and administrative operations, providing administrative capability delegation and privileged access management.

Each group was defined utilizing the posixGroup objectClass, which provides comprehensive group management attributes and ensures full compatibility with Unix/Linux group-based access control mechanisms. The posixGroup objectClass includes essential attributes such as:
   - Group name (cn)
   - Group identifier (gidNumber) - a unique numerical identifier for system-level group association
   - Member user identifiers (memberUid) - enabling association of individual users with the group
   - Group description attributes

This standardized group definition architecture establishes the foundation for role-based access control, group-based resource allocation, and unified policy enforcement across the institutional directory infrastructure.


II. USER GROUP MEMBERSHIP ASSIGNMENT AND CONFIGURATION

Following the successful establishment of organizational groups, the linkage of individual user accounts to their respective functional groups was implemented through systematic group membership assignment procedures. This association mechanism enables the propagation of group-based permissions, policies, and resource access privileges to individual users based on their organizational role.

Test users were strategically assigned to their respective primary groups as follows:

   • teacher User Account: The teacher user account was linked to the teachers organizational group through the assignment of the memberUid attribute within the teachers group entry. This association designates the teacher account as an active member of the faculty and instructional staff collective.
   
   • student User Account: The student user account was linked to the students organizational group through the assignment of the memberUid attribute within the students group entry. This association designates the student account as an active member of the enrolled learner population.

The memberUid attribute mechanism establishes a forward-referencing relationship from groups to users, enabling efficient resolution of group membership and facilitating rapid access control evaluation. This configuration provides the foundation for group-based authentication, authorization, and resource access policies that will be subsequently implemented in the institutional infrastructure.


III. CROSS-PLATFORM VALIDATION AND CONFIGURATION CONSISTENCY VERIFICATION

To ensure operational reliability and configuration consistency across the institutional management infrastructure, comprehensive verification procedures were executed utilizing both the phpLDAPadmin and LAM administrative platforms. This dual-platform verification methodology validates that the directory configuration is accurately represented across multiple management interfaces and that all administrative tools access consistent directory state.

The verification procedures encompassed the following validation activities:

   • Visibility Confirmation (phpLDAPadmin): Utilized the phpLDAPadmin attribute-level view to conduct detailed examination of all created group entries within the ou=Groups organizational unit. This verification confirmed that all group entries were properly stored within the directory and that their DN hierarchy structure was correctly configured.
   
   • Membership Status Validation (LAM): Employed the LAM user-centric interface to confirm the group membership associations from the user perspective. This verification validated that the memberUid assignments were correctly propagated and that each user account maintained accurate visibility of its group affiliations and collective membership status.
   
   • Structural Integrity Assessment: Verified that all group entries possessed the correct objectClass (posixGroup) and contained all mandatory attributes including:
     - Unique group identifier (gidNumber)
     - Group name (cn)
     - Member user identifier listings (memberUid)
   
   • Attribute-Level Consistency Verification: Confirmed through phpLDAPadmin's attribute inspection capabilities that all group attributes were accurately populated and maintained consistent values across both administrative platforms.
   
   • User-Centric Perspective Validation: Confirmed through LAM's user management interface that the group memberships were properly reflected from the user perspective, ensuring that users could query and verify their own group affiliations.

The successful completion of this comprehensive dual-platform verification confirmed that the group management infrastructure was functioning correctly, that all group and user associations were properly configured, and that both administrative interfaces provided consistent and accurate representation of the directory configuration.
