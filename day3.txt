Day 3: Organizing the Directory and User Schema (9 June)

I. Comparing LDAP Management Tools

Today I compared phpLDAPadmin and LAM (LDAP Account Manager) to see which is better for daily LDAP management. LAM’s form-based interface is much easier for regular tasks like adding or editing users, while phpLDAPadmin is more detailed but can be confusing for quick changes. I decided LAM is better for most day-to-day work, but phpLDAPadmin is still useful for advanced tweaks.

II. Setting Up Organizational Units (OUs)

I created two main OUs under the base DN (dc=college,dc=edu): one for users (ou=Users) and one for groups (ou=Groups). This helps keep things organized and makes it easier to manage permissions and group policies later on.

III. Choosing ObjectClasses for Users

For user entries, I set inetOrgPerson (for basic user info like name and email) and posixAccount (for Unix system integration) as required objectClasses. This way, every user has the right attributes for both directory and system logins. It keeps the directory consistent and ready for future integration with Linux systems.
