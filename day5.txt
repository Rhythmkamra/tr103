Day 5: Group Creation and Cross-Tool Checks (11 June)

I. Making Groups for Users

Today I set up three main groups in the directory: teachers, students, and societyadmins. Each group was created under ou=Groups and uses the posixGroup objectClass, which is needed for Unix-style group management. This setup will help with access control and organizing users by their roles.

II. Assigning Users to Groups

I linked the test teacher and student accounts to their respective groups by setting the memberUid attribute in each group entry. This way, group membership is clear and can be used for permissions and access checks later on.

III. Verifying in Both LAM and phpLDAPadmin

To make sure everything was set up right, I checked the group entries and memberships in both phpLDAPadmin (which shows all the attributes) and LAM (which is more user-focused). Both tools showed the correct group memberships and structure, so the configuration is consistent across platforms.
   • Structural Integrity Assessment: Verified that all group entries possessed the correct objectClass (posixGroup) and contained all mandatory attributes including:
     - Unique group identifier (gidNumber)
     - Group name (cn)
     - Member user identifier listings (memberUid)
   
   • Attribute-Level Consistency Verification: Confirmed through phpLDAPadmin's attribute inspection capabilities that all group attributes were accurately populated and maintained consistent values across both administrative platforms.
   
   • User-Centric Perspective Validation: Confirmed through LAM's user management interface that the group memberships were properly reflected from the user perspective, ensuring that users could query and verify their own group affiliations.

The successful completion of this comprehensive dual-platform verification confirmed that the group management infrastructure was functioning correctly, that all group and user associations were properly configured, and that both administrative interfaces provided consistent and accurate representation of the directory configuration.
