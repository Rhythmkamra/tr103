Day 20: End-to-End Workflow Testing (2 July)

I. Individual Leave Workflow Tests

Today I ran full end-to-end tests on the Individual Leave request process. I checked every stage: submitting the form (with both valid and invalid data), making sure the right status is set, and confirming the request is saved in the database. I tested mentor and HOD approvals, rejections, and all the notifications sent at each step. I also verified that only the right users can see or act on requests, and that the audit trail and data integrity are maintained throughout. Both success and rejection paths work as expected.

This comprehensive Individual Leave testing validates complete workflow functionality across all workflow stages

II. GROUP AND DUTY LEAVE WORKFLOW SEGREGATION AND AUTO-APPROVAL TESTING

     - Approval Queue Segregation: Verification that approval queues maintain workflow separation

This comprehensive Group and Duty Leave testing validates workflow segregation and auto-approval functionality.
