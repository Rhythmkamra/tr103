Day 12: Leave Request UI and Dashboard (20 June)

I. Leave Request Submission Template

Today I built the HTML templates for the leave request form. I used Django’s form rendering to display all the fields, added labels, help text, and CSRF protection. For dates, I integrated a JavaScript date picker so students can easily select start and end dates. The reason field is a multi-line text area with a character counter and real-time validation. There are clear submit and cancel buttons, plus links for help if needed. The goal was to make the form simple and user-friendly.

II. Leave Request Tracking Dashboard

I also created a dashboard where students can see all their leave requests. It shows each request in a table with the dates, duration, current status, and actions like view, edit (if pending), or cancel. This makes it easy for users to keep track of their requests and know what’s happening at each stage.
   
   • Status Indicators: Visual status indicators providing clear workflow status communication:
     - PENDING_MENTOR: Yellow/amber status indicating awaiting Mentor review
     - MENTOR_APPROVED: Blue status indicating Mentor approval completed
     - PENDING_HOD: Orange status indicating awaiting HOD review
     - HOD_APPROVED: Green status indicating fully approved
     - REJECTED: Red status indicating request rejection
     - CANCELLED: Gray status indicating cancelled by student
   
   • Request Detail View: Comprehensive display of individual request details including:
     - Student information and request identifier
     - Leave date specifications and calculated duration
     - Provided leave reason and justification
     - Complete workflow history showing all status changes and timestamps
     - Approval authority comments and decisions
     - Contact information for relevant approval authorities

This comprehensive tracking dashboard enables students to monitor leave request progression and understand approval status.


III. MENTOR AND HOD APPROVAL INTERFACE TEMPLATES

The implementation of approval authority interfaces proceeded with development of specialized templates enabling Mentors and HODs to review and approve/reject leave requests.

The approval interface implementation encompasses the following components:

   • Approval Queue Display: A prioritized list of pending requests requiring approval action:
     - Request summary information (student, dates, duration)
     - Request submission timestamp
     - Priority indicators based on leave date proximity
     - Action links for request review and approval decisions
   
   • Request Review Interface: Comprehensive detail display for individual request review including:
     - Complete student information and identification
     - Leave date specifications with visual calendar display
     - Provided leave reason and justification
     - Historical workflow information and prior approvals
     - Related coursework or academic schedule information
   
   • Approval Decision Controls: Interface elements enabling approval/rejection decisions:
     - Approve button with optional comment field
     - Reject button with required reason field
     - Return/request additional information option
     - Bulk action capabilities for multiple request processing

This comprehensive approval interface enables efficient leave request review and authorization by appropriate approval authorities.
